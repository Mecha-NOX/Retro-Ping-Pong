# **Ping Pong**

*Retro Sports Gameplay | Developed in Raylib C++*

---

## **Overview**

*Ping Pong* is a two-player recreation of the classic Ping Pong game. Developed using C++ and Raylib, this project demonstrates my ability to implement basic physics, AI behavior for single-player mode, and responsive controls for multiplayer gameplay.

---

## **Features**

- **•Two-Player Gameplay**
Two players can control paddles to hit a ball back and forth, scoring when the opponent fails to return the ball.

- **•AI Opponent**
In single-player mode, the game features a basic AI opponent that can return the ball based on its speed and position.

- **•Score Tracking**
The score is displayed, and players earn points when the opponent misses the ball.

- **•Responsive Controls**
Keyboard controls for both the player paddles, ensuring a smooth experience.
